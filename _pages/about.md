[CV](/assets/pdf/Chawin_Sitawarin_CV.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&authuser=1&user=AxUAEQ4AAAAJ)

**I am looking for a full-time researcher or a postdoc position (starting Spring 2024 or after) Please feel free to reach out!**

Hello! My name is Chawin Sitawarin (ชวิน สีตวาริน).
I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, and I am a part of [the security group](https://security.cs.berkeley.edu/), [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley DeepDrive (BDD)](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/).
My advisor is [Prof. David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/).
I have also spent some time at IBM Research, Nokia Bell Labs, and Google Research.

I am broadly interested in the security and safety aspects of machine learning. Most of my previous works are in the domain of adversarial machine learning, particularly adversarial examples and robustness of machine learning algorithms.
More recently, I am interested in large language models both as a target for new kinds of attacks and as a security-enhancing tool.
<!-- If you are wondering why I appear as a panda, give this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf) a read. -->

Previously, I graduated from Princeton University in 2018 where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Prateek Mittal](https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/), [Prof. Peter Ramadge](http://faculty.ee.princeton.edu/ramadge/doku.html), and [Prof. Alejandro Rodriguez](http://faculty.ee.princeton.edu/arodriguez/). I was mentored and introduced to adversarial machine learning by [Arjun Bhagoji](https://arjunbhagoji.github.io/).

I used to keep track of papers on adversarial examples, but I stopped after the number of papers has become overwhelming. You can still find the list [here](https://github.com/chawins/Adversarial-Examples-Reading-List) (last update: Sep 2019).
